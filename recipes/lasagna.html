    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>One of my family's favorite recipes. I make this at least twice a month, if not more.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cooked chicken, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can artichokes in water, drained</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil, drained and chopped</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried basil, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
   

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Mix chicken, artichokes, shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, and sun-dried tomatoes together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese, milk, 1 tablespoon basil, and garlic powder together in a bowl until smooth. Mix 2/3 of the cream cheese mixture with the chicken mixture. Spread remaining cream cheese mixture into the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Spread a single layer of lasagna noodles over the cream cheese mixture, top with 1/3 of the chicken mixture, and a layer of mozzarella cheese slices. Repeat layering with noodles, chicken mixture, and mozzarella slices 2 times. Top with remaining Parmesan cheese and basil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbling, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
