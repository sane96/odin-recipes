    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Delicious and creamy! This recipe is my brother's favorite of everything that I cook, and the first one I mastered.</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li> 
        <li>½ pound fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into strips</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons margarine</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced mushrooms (Optional)</li>
        <li>½ small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ red bell pepper, cubed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>¾ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons shredded Swiss cheese, divided</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried thyme, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken strips in the hot oil until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Remove chicken to a bowl, leaving pan drippings in skillet. Melt margarine in the hot skillet; cook and stir mushrooms, onion, and garlic in skillet until mushrooms have softened and given up their liquid, about 5 minutes. Stir red bell pepper into mixture and sprinkle with flour. Stir to coat and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Slowly mix chicken broth into vegetables, stirring to form a thick sauce; mix cream and milk into sauce. Simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. Mix 1/2 cup Swiss cheese, 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, thyme, salt, and black pepper into sauce and simmer until cheese have melted and combined with sauce.</li>
        <li>Spread half the cooked fettuccine pasta into bottom of prepared casserole dish, top with half the chicken and half the cream sauce. Repeat layers once more and sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons Swiss cheese, 2 tablespoons Cheddar cheese, and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese topping is nicely browned, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
